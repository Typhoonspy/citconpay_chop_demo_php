# Citcon Hosted Online Payment (CHOP) Demo in PHP

CHOP is Citcon's online payment product that helps online merchants quickly integrate a full payment solution. 

Using hosted payment solutions by Citcon, merchants development cost is dramatically reduced because almost everything in the payment flow is built, hosted and managed by Citcon. This also significantly redeuced the liability and effort merchants otherwise have to be concerned with on security and data privacy. For example, merchants, who are taking credit card payments, normally need to be cerified by PCI-DSS; now, merchants only need to self-certify with PCI-DSS SAQ A-EP.

Better yet, merchants can customize the look and feel of the hosted forms via simple HTML and CSS.

Please read Citcon API documentation for details: http://doc.citconpay.com

This is a PHP demo and sample code for Citcon Hosted Online Payment APIs. Supports Alipay, WeChat Pay, Credit Cards. Feel free to use it and/or modify to suit your needs.
